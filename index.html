			<h5> <div class="div-justify">Hi! my name is <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>. I'm currenty a phd student at the LAB-STICC laboaratory at IMT Atlantique, France under the supervision of Prof. Yannis Haralambous and Prof. Philippe Lenca. My doctoral research focuses on studying of semantic representation for french language based on using the Combinatory Categorial Grammar and Discours Representation Theory.</div></h5>
			<h5><div class="div-justify">Understanding natural language is extremely complex task for ameliorating the capacity of human-computer interaction because the meaning of an utterance is not only dependent on using vocabularies, grammars but also on the context of the communication. In addition, the explosion of neural network research brings diversity of deep neural network architectures as well as effective solutions about performance and accuracy in different fields. According to this view, my interesting domain research is Natural Language Understanding, Semantic Representation and Deep Neural Networks.</div></h5>
