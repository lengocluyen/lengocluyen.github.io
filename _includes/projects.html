			In this project, our focus is on examining various recommender systems customized for the vehicle domain through a comprehensive analysis of existing algorithms. We consider diverse factors, including user preferences, historical interactions, and a semantic understanding of vehicle features, aiming to develop specialized recommendation models that not only factor in traditional aspects like make and model but also incorporate user-specific preferences and contextual information within the automotive market. The integration of ontologies enhances our ability to represent complex relationships, providing a nuanced understanding of user needs. Our research extends to estimating semantic similarity among vehicles, contributing to the evolution of recommendation systems beyond statistical associations. Ultimately, our goal is to advance recommender systems within the vehicle domain, delivering personalized and contextually relevant suggestions that align seamlessly with users' unique preferences and requirements.

			- Studies of the genetic and phenotypic diversity of Asian and African rice varieties require the manipulation of a large volume of data which are in fact heterogeneous in nature and stored in different forms. In this context, we have developed a generic integration and indexing tool in order to be able to navigate, share and annotate this data.

			- Implementing a tool to extract concepts and terms from pdf text files based on the patterns of POS tagging analysis from input sentences and frequency of occurrence of concepts and terms in general context. As a result, the triplet data set matching the common SVO structure from the input statements was constructed.

			- Combinatory Categorial Grammars (CCG) provide an interface between surface syntax and underlying semantic representation. In this work, we implement a novel approach for building CCG derivation trees from dependency syntax trees, and apply it to French language. We first introduce an algorithm for binarizing the syntax tree structure. Then, we  assign lexical categories by considering the context and dependency relations of words and word classes. Finally we build complete derivations by using the binary tree and CCG combinatory rules. The method is evaluated over the 21,550-sentence French Treebank Corpus.

			We use the French CCG corpus and the Groningen Tree Bank corpus for the English language, to train a new BiLSTM+CRF neural architecture that uses (a)~morphosyntactic input features and (b)~feature correlations as input features. We show experimentally that for an inflected language like French, dependency syntax information allows significant improvement of the accuracy of the CCG supertagging task, when using deep learning techniques.</div>
