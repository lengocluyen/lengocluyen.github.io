# use a current Jekyll release directly; github-pages gem currently pulls in
# Jekyll 3.9 which crashes on Ruby 3.3.  We're building on Vercel so the
# GitHub‑Pages wrapper isn't required.
gem 'jekyll', '~> 4.3'

gem "webrick", "~> 1.8"

gem "rubyzip", "~> 2.3.0"  # pin to avoid warnings about named parameters

gem 'csv'  # explicit dependency; CSV will be removed from stdlib in Ruby 3.4
